Enter your first quaternary number using the numerical buttons, then select your mathematical operation. If required enter your second quaternary number and press the equal sign to see the result. By pressing the top left button (icon is different depending on OS) it will convert the quaternary number to its corresponding decimal number and vice versa. For the square root and square buttons, only one number can be entered. The c button will clear the operation and operands entered.
